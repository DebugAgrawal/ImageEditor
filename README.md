* ##### Chroma Key effect.
  `Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual-effects and post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on colour hues`
* ##### Gray Scale effect.
  `The Grayscale is an effect that provides transition effect from colored image to monochrome image or vice-versa. `
* ##### Image Steganography.
  `Steganography is data hidden within data. Steganography is an encryption technique that can be used along with cryptography as an extra-secure method in which to protect data.`
* ##### Color Overlay.
  `It creates a layer of RGB color over the image provided having a transparable opacity`
* ##### Rainbow filter.
  `It creates a layer of VIBGYOR color over the image provided having a transparable opacity`
